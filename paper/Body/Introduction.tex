\section{Introduction}
Data partitioning is a process of dividing data into blocks among multiple threads. Each thread execute the same instructions on its designated block of data which in theory should results in a speed up of some sort. This investigation therefore aims to explore this approach using pthreads and median filter- which utilize statistics to remove extraneous values(noise) from data sets. The data set can be of arbitrary dimensions, however in this case only images will be used.

% \linebreak stretches the line that is broken to the end of the column.  Use "\\" or "\newline" if you don't want it to do this.
