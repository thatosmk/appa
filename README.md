# Appar

Writing documents made easy.

## What is it good for
Everytime you start a tex document, this helps you to generate templates for you and also
creates a git repo for your document versions when you come back to edit.

## How it works
`appa create`
> creates a new tex document and opens latexmk on a new terminal. 


`appa open`
> opens an existing tex document in a new branch(```staging```) and merges on completion of editing the
> document. Also open a pdf and latexmk for easy editing and viewing.
